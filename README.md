# Project Overview

Welcome to the wiki of the **CloudSimEx** project!

The goal of the **CloudSimEx** project is to develop a set of extensions for the CloudSim simulator. The extensions that prove to be worthy will be merged with CloudSim later on.

**Note!** These extensions are not officially supported by the CloudSim team until they are integrated with CloudSim.

Currently **CloudSimEx** features:

* Web session modelling; 
* Better logging utilities; 
* Utilities for generating CSV files for statistical analysis; 
* Automatic id generation;
* Utilities for running multiple experiments in parallel;
* Utilities for modelling network latencies;
* MapReduce simulation.
